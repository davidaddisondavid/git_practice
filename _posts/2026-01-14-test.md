But it doesn’t feel like a song about loneliness or marginalisation, love and mercy wins out. I think you can hear this happening musically: the chorus, a perfect gem of Brian Wilson pop, refuses to go away, returning again and again in full earnestness. Even when the song dissolves into a bridge section of haunting chamber harmonies and minor chords, it only takes one shout of ‘HeyYy’ and we’re back. That second half of the song is perfect to me, it sums up everything I love about Brian and the Beach Boys - the ease with which their music crosses between two disparate emotional worlds, the ability and willingness to move from a tightly arranged passage of angelic wails directly into a catchy, twee pop chorus.

Going to the cinema on my own is something I do when I feel lonely, maybe because the act of watching a film involves a room of people sitting in silence together, everyone having their own experience but hopefully sharing in one as well. Every time I leave the cinema I leave with a smile and a feeling of love and mercy.

## Nunhead Cemetery / A Day in the Life of a Tree (Surf’s Up) 

The Beach Boys advertised the release of 1971’s Surf’s Up with the slogan ‘It’s now safe to listen to the Beach Boys’. Following a period of commercial failure in the late 60s, Brian and the boys brought on Jack Rieley as their new manager, who formulated a plan to rebrand the group as an ‘ecological’ band who were in touch with the hippie counterculture. The ‘ecological’ album which came out of these efforts is an awkward masterpiece, one of their best albums almost in spite of itself. Some of its best songs (‘Disney Girls’, ‘Long Promised Road’ and ‘Surf’s Up’, the title track) bear little relation to Rieley’s vision for a politically urgent Beach Boys record. Whereas the album’s most straightforwardly political song, ‘Student Demonstration Time’, is a disaster – a smug and shallow blues tune about the state murder of student protesters.
